## Name
Alchemy

## Description
Alchemy is a web application that allows its users to classify their fridge and pantry ingredients from a single scanned image to produce multiple recipes using different combinations of those ingredients.

Using two powerful APIs, Alchemy intends to empower individuals with a limited variety of ingredients to unlock innovative recipes and reduce food waste.

Our web app also accomodates for dietary preferences, dietary restrictions, and ingredient quantities to produce recipes that fit your personal needs.

## Installation (NOT ADDED)
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
To use the Alchemy web application, follow these steps:
**Homepage:**

Navigate to the homepage's single upload button to upload an image of the ingredients that you would like to be scanned.

For your image, ingredients should ideally be spread evenly across a clean, blank surface.

Once the image is successfully uploaded you will receive a confirmation. The website also displays a preview of the image for your reference. 

Then navigate to the ‘continue’ button to move on to the next page.

**Modify Ingredients**

This page will allow you to view and edit the scanned ingredient list, which is to create your generated recipes.

Click on the '✏️' button of any ingredient to modify ingredient's quantity or unit of measurement. The classification model is not yet able to identify these properties.

Click on the '❌' button of any ingredient to delete that ingredient.

**Specify Dietary Preferences**

Click the checkboxes of any of the dietary preferences to indicate this selection for use in recipe generation.

Scroll down to access the calorie and time limit sliders, which can be used as additional parameters for your recipe.

Scroll down to the 'Other Preferences' section, an open ended textbox that allows for additional preferences.

An example of this request may look like: 'I don't have access to a frying pan'

After all forms are filled, navigate to the 'Submit' button to continue to the next page.

**Explore Recipes**

Here, all of the recipes are displayed with their titles shown above. 

The recipes list all of the ingredients along with the measurement required to create the recipe, the cooking time required, and the cooking instructions.

## Roadmap (NOT ADDED)
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing (NOT ADDED)
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
